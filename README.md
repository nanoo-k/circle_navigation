circle_navigation
=================

Tired of blocky navigation? This circle-based alternative aligns vertically and works with sub-menus.

Thanks to vals from StackOverflow, this now works with multiple submenus. By manually assigning the position of each submenu item, all submenus will open identically. (i.e. The first submenu item always opens toward the same position, and the second always opens to the same second position, etc.).

##Got ideas?

If you have an idea for improving this navigation scheme, send me an email at Linkedin.com/in/MiguelValencia.
