circle_navigation
=================

Tired of blocky navigation? This circle-based alternative aligns vertically and works with sub-menus.

## Help
This module is not complete. Please help if you can!

- [ ] Because sub-menus rely heavily on adjusting the top and left properties, this module does not work with multiple sub-menus (try for yourself by opening "multiple-sub-menu.html" or viewing the jsFiddles linked below).

Single sub-menu (works): http://jsfiddle.net/na_ook/Px83f/

Multiple sub-menu (broken): http://jsfiddle.net/na_ook/b3ka7/1/
